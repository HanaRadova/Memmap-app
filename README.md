# Memmap

Memmap is an app aimed at planning holidays and preserving memories from those trips even after they're over. Users can therefore use the app to efficiently organize their plans by breaking them down into days and visualizing them through maps. During the vacation itself, it is possible to assign a photo with a short description to each day and location to document the experience.

This project was my term paper for the course Cloud Application Architecture. So during the semester I created a basic frontend, backend as well as a business request and model. The application is still under development.
